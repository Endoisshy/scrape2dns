# scrape2dns
A bash script to scrape a wordlist from a webpage, enumerate valid subdomains, then dump TXT records.

This is meant to serve more as a template for any number of other DNS enumerations. Or in a case when you don't have access to web scraping tools the first half of the script can be handy.
